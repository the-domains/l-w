## [A Whale of a Time][0]

The idea of whale watching has always appealed to me. I've seen many documentaries about whales and of course, have watched the animated film Finding Nemo. I find these giant mammals fascinating, and I couldn't think of a more thrilling experience than coming face to face with one of these leviathans.
